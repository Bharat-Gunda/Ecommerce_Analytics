### Process
1. **Data Understanding** - The key to success on any data project is to understand the data in detail. Therefore, we took the time to comprehend the data model and domain of the eCommerce business. This involved familiarizing ourselves with various datasets related to customers, orders, products, sellers, and geographical information.

2. **Data Cleaning** - After gaining a thorough understanding of the business and its data, we proceeded to clean the available datasets. This step involved identifying and rectifying any inconsistencies like comments, missing values, and errors in the data. We ensured that the datasets were accurate and prepared for further analysis by standardizing formats and removing duplicates.

3. **Data Modeling** - With the cleaned data, we then focused on processing and modeling this data into structured datasets that could effectively answer the business questions. This step involved creating relationships between different datasets, deriving new variables, and aggregating data in a way that facilitated insightful analysis. 

4. **Data Analysis** - Using the newly modeled dataset, we applied our analytical expertise to uncover meaningful insights. This step involved performing various statistical analyses, identifying patterns and trends, and generating key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business objectives. Additionally, we created visualizations using tools like Tableau to clearly communicate these insights.
